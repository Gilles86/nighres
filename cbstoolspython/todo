* change naming /saving conventions in all interfaces using new functions
* default directories for atlases and LUTs (change in mgdm and layering)
* skullstrip
* full example (which inputs?)
* I/O test if input is an image and raise valid error

MGDM
Inputs
* I find the intputs con1, con1_type, con2 etc. very hard to understand unless someone is intimately familiar with the MGDM algorithm. Could we rename them to  "input_img_1", "contrast_type_1", "input_img_2" etc ? Or do you have a different idea? I would also try to work on a more informative docstring for those inputs then
* Why are these inputs given as lists? It makes the interface (as well as the code) a bit complicated. Is this to run multiple subjects at once?
If so, wouldnt it be easier to have the interface just to run for one subject and then people can loop / parallelize multiple subjects by calling the interface multiple times? We could also think about providing a little utility for parallelizing pipelines later

Additional funcitons
* These functions (https://github.com/juhuntenburg/cbstools-python/blob/master/cbstoolspython/brain/mgdm.py) are not directly necessary for just using MGDM right? Except "get_MGDM_contrast_names"

Orientation / Flipping
* There are some comments about the image orientation and a function for flipping, which i is not used however. Do we need any flipping?

PyPI:
* update setup.py
* remake wheel
* rename wheel
* upload to PyPI

requirements:
* nibabel
* numpy
* os
* cbstools

later
* mute java output
* java VM hepasizes -> make variable?
* Python 3
