* change naming /saving conventions in all interfaces using new functions
* default directories for atlases and LUTs (change in mgdm and layering)
* skullstrip
* full example (which inputs?)
* I/O test if input is an image and raise valid error

MGDM
* collect other outputs, fix suffixes
* maybe catch specific errors
* docstring update

Additional funcitons
* These functions (https://github.com/juhuntenburg/cbstools-python/blob/master/cbstoolspython/brain/mgdm.py) are not directly necessary for just using MGDM right? Except "get_MGDM_contrast_names"

Orientation / Flipping
* There are some comments about the image orientation and a function for flipping, which i is not used however. Do we need any flipping?

PyPI:
* update setup.py
* remake wheel
* rename wheel
* upload to PyPI

requirements:
* nibabel
* numpy
* os
* cbstools

later
* mute java output
* java VM hepasizes -> make variable?
* Python 3
