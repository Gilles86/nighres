## Wisdom of the crowd

This week, GSoC started with the "community bonding" phase. I already feel pretty bonded with my software community (in fact I constitute 1/3rd of it), so I use the time to reach out to the larger neuroimaging community regarding one of the first issues I want to address: 

*What is the best way to distribute the Python version of CBS Tools?*

I have previously discussed this question with my mentors and other colleagues, and one suggestion that came up is to deploy the tools via [docker](https://www.docker.com/). In order to find out what neuroimaging folks think about docker I have started discussion threads on [neurostars](https://neurostars.org/t/using-docker-to-distribute-highres-neuroimaging-software/442) and in the [brainhack slack team](https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/). 

I know very little about docker myself, so I also started watching some [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAAzevEST2qm2Xbe3aeLFvLc). Whether we end up using it or not, my feeling is it won't hurt in the future to know a thing or two about docker. 


## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

On this site I will document my work during the Google Summer of Code 2017 with INCF. The fulll project proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lkcTpcYT1r1qwh4GwccyWjY3cq2VZ89AlQoKa4Fd2aQ/edit?usp=sharing).
